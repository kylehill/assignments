## CSS Zen Garden

### Description

History lesson! The [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a famous site in the history of front-end development. It has a [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Zen_Garden) page, so you know it's legit.

The concept behind the CSS Zen Garden is that there's only a single page's worth of HTML on the site -- that HTML has content which explains the task and requirements to anyone interested in submitting a design. The only variable is the stylesheet attached to the page. Examples on the Zen Garden radically alter the presentation and experience of the site without touching the HTML itself.

The site itself served the purpose of illustrating the true power of CSS to web developers in the bad old days of tabular layouts and specifying display properties inside outmoded HTML elements; it's fair to say that it's done as much for modern front-end conceptions of quality as any other resource.

As a tribute to the Zen Garden, we're going to do our own CSS-only exercise. **We're going to re-create the mock images provided, but only use CSS.** The HTML has been created for you - `current.html` and `future.html`. You'll notice that the HTML is the same in both files, except for that it references a different stylesheet.

This assignment (especially the Hard Mode) may be quite difficult, but since it's microfocused on one part of visual presentation, your struggle should be productive.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Feel confident when using CSS display and positioning
* Feel masterful when using more straightforward CSS properties
* Be able to break comps down into their component parts and determine a plan of attack


## Easy Mode

The practice of Zen is never focused on any specific goal, but on furthering the inward journey experienced by the practitioner. In that way, this assignment is not intended to be graded for credit towards some sense of completion, but to be used as a learning experience for oneself.

Simply ask, and I'll give you the `future.css` and `current.css` files that I used to create the mockups. You should endeavor to play with those, modify them, and break them in order to find out what makes them tick.

## Normal Mode

Use CSS to re-create the styling and layout of the existing site -- `current.html`. Only modify `current.css`. Do not modify the contents of `current.html`.

## Hard Mode

Use CSS to re-create the styling and layout of the "redesigned" site -- `future.html`. Only modify `future.css`. Do not modify the contents of `future.html`.
