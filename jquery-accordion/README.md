## Normal Mode

Build a vertical accordion, mirroring the setup in the `accordion.gif` file. There should be any number of section headers that contain some hidden content; when a user clicks on any of the section headers, then the currently visible content is hidden and the content belonging to the clicked-upon header is shown.

By default, the first section's content should be visible when the page is loaded.

You should create a new repository for this project and host it on GitHub via the `gh-pages` branch.

Note: You are **not** allowed to use `$.slideUp`, `$.slideDown`, or `$.slideToggle during this assignment. No using `$.animate` either; please implement any animations with the CSS `transition` property.

## Hard Mode

Build a *horizontal* slider (same stuff, but everything is rotated ninety degrees to the left or right.)
