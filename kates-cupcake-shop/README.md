## Kate's Cupcake Shop

### Description

We're all comfortable with using JavaScript now, right? Let's put our code to the test.

We're going to write the code to do some simple business management for our friend Kate. She owns a cupcake shop (which is called "CupKates" because I like obnoxious puns), and having some inventory management and point-of-sale software would make her life a heck of a lot easier.

The first thing we're going to do is write the initial version of the software, making the tests pass like we've done in our previous assignments. We're going to **release** the software at that point.

Once that's done, we're going to add new features. This will require *you* to write the tests, and then make them pass.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand all the Good Parts in native JavaScript
* Be comfortable with a TDD workflow -- not just making tests pass, but writing them as well
* Understand common functional programming paradigms, and how to implement them with underscore.js

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Simple node.js web server applications
* underscore.js
* Loops to iterate over objects and arrays
* Big honkin' objects
* Test-driven development

## Details

This assignment consists of a simple test runner that's performing tests on functions that we need to complete.

## Normal Mode -- Step 1

First off, make all the tests pass. Same as it ever was. This may be a little tricker than usual; there's plenty of them.

**When you are done with all of the tests, create a git commit.**

After you've created the git commit, enter this command:

`git tag initial-release`

This creates a little convenient flag that lets anyone that's looking at your code base know that this specific commit is special.

## Normal Mode -- Step 2

Remember how a test-driven development workflow operates.

1. Write new tests that **fail**.
2. Implement the new functionality.
3. All tests (old and new) should **pass**.

We're going to add the following features. You should do it in a TDD way.

* tbd feature 1
* tbd feature 2
* tbd feature 3
