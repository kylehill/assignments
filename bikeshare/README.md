## Capital Bikeshare

### Description

This assignment serves to introduce the concepts of working with an API and asynchronous code, specifically in a test-driven way.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand asynchronous JavaScript
* Understand AJAX
* Understand iterating over an array with underscore

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* jQuery AJAX
* Asynchronous test-driven JavaScript

## Details

The code that runs this application serves up static files, like other applications, but also serves an additional route -- `/stations` -- which responds with JSON data, containing an array of objects representing the data for each of the stations in the [Capital Bikeshare](http://capitalbikeshare.com) system.

We're going to write the front end JavaScript that consumes the data from this route, transferred via AJAX.

## Normal Mode

Make all five tests pass.

## Nightmare Mode

Using the data returned with the API, make something interesting.
