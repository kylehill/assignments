## Backbone - Models and Events

### Description

An intro assignment for our section on Backbone.js. We'll handle just Backbone.Model and Backbone.Events for starters. This should be a gentle introduction into these foundational Backbone concepts.

### Normal Mode - Step 1

Read through the following sections in the Backbone documentation:

* [Introduction](http://backbonejs.org/#introduction)
* [Events](http://backbonejs.org/#Events)
* [Model](http://backbonejs.org/#Model)

### Normal Mode - Step 2

Standard TDD assignment -- just make the tests pass.

### Additional Objectives

Go back and finish up work on TodoRPG; you're welcome to bring Backbone into the mix on the client-side. We won't cover Backbone's interaction with HTML for another couple days, but it might be worthwhile to use Backbone Models to represent task data.
