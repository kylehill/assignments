## JavaScript - Data Types and TDD

### Description

Today we covered an introduction to the basics of JavaScript. We talked about variables, and about primitive types (numbers, strings, booleans, and `undefined`). We talked about operators. We talked about control flow - code blocks, `if` and `else`, and `for` and `while` loops.

We've also spent some time talking about test-driven development, and the kinds of tools that let us make use of it.

This assignment will serve as an introduction to both.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand the basics of JavaScript variables and primitive types
* Understand the basics of JavaScript operators and control flow
* Understand a very simple test-driven development workflow

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Basic JavaScript
* Advanced TDD tools: Mocha and Chai
* node.js and Express, to start and run a web server

## Details

This assignment consists of a simple test runner that's performing a whole of tests on reasonably straightforward operations.

## Normal Mode

Replace the `_BLANK_` variables with the appropriate values in `public/index.js` and `public/test/test.index.js`. So if a line consists of:

```js
expect(2 + 2).to.equal(_BLANK_);
```

You should replace it with:

```js
expect(2 + 2).to.equal(4);
```

All tests must be passing when you reload the page.

## Hard Mode

Write some of your own passing tests for each section.
